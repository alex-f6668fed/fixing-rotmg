_[The Realm](/The%20Realm) / Nexus Portals_

# Nexus Realms

There is significant issue with the way realms currently work from the nexus. Each server is given 1-2 portals to a realm, each realm is one of 16 random maps, with 40-50 Heroes of Oryx. There is no distinction between realms aside from name.

There are a few issues with this approach:
* Having multiple realms in multiple servers with a small player base far too easily divides those few players
* No incentive to choose certain realms
* Starting each realm with large Heroes of Oryx counts serves only as a barrier to endgame content
* Monotony kills player retention

Let's address each issue on its own with potential solutions, with a final section giving some examples of how a cohesive change set would revolutionize the existing gameplay loop.
