# Fixing Realm of the Mad God

RotMG is a game that's been around for a long time, enough to pass between three different owners. As a consequence of this time, and change in leadership, there are glaring issues with the game that actively hinder playerbase growth and retention.

This project aims to be an open letter to DECA, signed by the community, on what we believe would heal the wounds left by Realm's rocky development history.

The structure of the repo is loosely based on RealmEye's wiki, each directory containing a general overview page. There is however a dedicated section to monetization, as many of the suggestions elsewhere negatively impact the p2w aspect of the game.
